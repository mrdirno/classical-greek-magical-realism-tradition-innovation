## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a modern artisan, a potter or blacksmith, discovers their material has a 'song' or consciousness. How do they react, and what conflict does it create?
- Create a 'found document'—a page from Alexios's sketchbook detailing the properties and 'moods' of different materials (marble, oak, bronze, clay).
- Imagine a prequel story about Theron, detailing the mission where he first encountered the *baskanos* in the 'tomb that should have stayed sealed'.
- Write a dialogue between Lykos and another apprentice years later, where Lykos tries to explain his master's methods and the reality of the 'watchers'.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a 'Material Resonance' system for a game or interactive story, where players must 'listen' to objects to solve puzzles or craft items with unique properties.
- Create a visual mood board or style guide for the novel, blending classical Greek architectural/motif references with a magical, textured realism.
